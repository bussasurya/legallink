                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Divorce is the legal termination of a marriage. In India, the process and grounds for divorce vary based on the 
                    religion of the spouses. The governing laws include the 
                    <strong> Hindu Marriage Act, 1955</strong>, 
                    <strong> Special Marriage Act, 1954</strong>, 
                    <strong> Indian Divorce Act, 1869</strong> (for Christians), and 
                    <strong> Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939</strong>.  
                    A divorce can be obtained through <strong>mutual consent</strong> or as a <strong>contested divorce</strong>.

                <h3>1. Divorce by Mutual Consent (Section 13B, Hindu Marriage Act, 1955)</h3>
                <p>
                    In a mutual consent divorce, both husband and wife agree to dissolve their marriage peacefully without conflict.
                    This is the simplest and quickest form of divorce.
                </p>

                    <li><strong>Second Motion:</strong> If both still agree, the court grants a decree of divorce.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Timeframe:</h4>
                <p>
                    Normally, mutual consent divorce takes between <strong>6 to 12 months</strong>, depending on court schedules and documentation.
