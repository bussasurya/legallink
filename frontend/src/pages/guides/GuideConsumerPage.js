        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Consumer Protection Act, 2019</strong> is the key law safeguarding the interests of consumers in India.  
          It provides an effective mechanism for grievance redressal, defines unfair trade practices, regulates e-commerce, and empowers consumers with specific rights.
          It replaced the older 1986 Act and introduced new digital-age provisions like product liability, e-commerce regulation, and mediation.
