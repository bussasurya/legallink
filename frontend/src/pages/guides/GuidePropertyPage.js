                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Property disputes are among the most common civil issues in India. 
                    These can arise over ownership, partition, inheritance, transfer, or possession of property.
                    Property laws are governed primarily by the 
                    <strong> Transfer of Property Act, 1882</strong>, 
                    <strong> Hindu Succession Act, 1956</strong>, and 
                    <strong> Indian Succession Act, 1925</strong>.

                <h3>1. Types of Property</h3>
                <h4>🔹 Ancestral Property</h4>
                <p>
                    Ancestral property is inherited through four generations of the male lineage (father, grandfather, great-grandfather, great-great-grandfather).  
                    Every coparcener (legal heir by birth) has an equal right to the property.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rights arise by birth, not by will.</li>
                    <li>Cannot be sold or gifted without the consent of all legal heirs.</li>
                    <li>Daughters have equal rights after the <strong>Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>🔹 Self-Acquired Property</h4>
                <p>
                    Self-acquired property refers to any property bought, inherited, or received by an individual through lawful means — not as part of joint family property.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The owner has full control and can sell, gift, or will it to anyone.</li>
                    <li>Legal heirs cannot claim rights during the owner’s lifetime.</li>
                    <li>Disputes arise when transfer or gift is challenged as being made under coercion or fraud.</li>
                </ul>
